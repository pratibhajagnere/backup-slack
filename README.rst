slack_history
=============

This is a tool for backing up your message history from Slack.

It uses the Slack API to download the history of your public/private
channels and direct message threads, and save them as a JSON file.
(The `data exports <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248>`_
provided by Slack only include messages sent in public channels.)
If you're using one of the paid tiers, this retrieves your complete
history.  For the free tiers, only the last 10,000 messages are accessible
through the Slack API.
